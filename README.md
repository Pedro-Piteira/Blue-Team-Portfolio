# Blue-Team-Portfolio

ðŸš€ Objective

Become a Blue Team professional capable of detection, response, and threat hunting in both on-prem and cloud environments. This repository showcases practical projects, performance metrics, and instructions to reproduce labs.

ðŸ§­ Roadmap (High-Level)

Fundamentals of networking, logs, and operating systems

SIEM configuration and tuning (ELK, Splunk, or open-source alternatives)

EDR & Endpoint hardening (Osquery, Wazuh, Sysmon)

Forensics and incident response

Threat Hunting & advanced detections (MITRE ATT&CK mapping)

Cloud security (AWS/GCP/Azure basics + logging)

ðŸ“Š Metrics and Performance (what I show)

Mean Time To Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time To Respond (MTTR) in labs (goal: MTTD < 15 min, MTTR < 60 min for exercises).

Detection Coverage: percentage of attacks detected by rules/alerts in a controlled scenario.

Tuning Iterations: number of iterations per alert until acceptable false positive rate (e.g., 3 iterations for rules with >10% false positives).

Forensic Cases Solved: list of CTFs/labs with writeups and average resolution time.

ðŸ§° Tools I Work With

SIEM: ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Splunk (labs).

Endpoint: Osquery, Wazuh, Sysmon (Windows).

Network: Zeek, Suricata, tcpdump, Wireshark.

Forensics: Volatility, Autopsy.

Scripting: Python (automation of ingestion/analysis), Bash, PowerShell.

Infra: Docker, Terraform (examples of reproducible labs).****
